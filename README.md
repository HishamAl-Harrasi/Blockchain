# Simple Blockchain Application

This application is a little side project I am working on which involves creating a small blockchain which implements all of the main functionalities of a standard blockchain.

### Stage One

Stage One involves creating the actual blockchain data structure, and all the properties and methods required to create and run the blockchain on my local machine

### Stage Two

Stage Two will involve allowing the blockchain to be distributed and synced on multiple nodes, with implementations of consensus algorithms and syncing of the blockchain
